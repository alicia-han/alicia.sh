## When pb with terraform plan 
terraform state list 
terraform state rm XXXXX

## When the creation is successful, but terraform would like to replace, we should untaint resources:

terraform untaint  proxmox_vm_qemu.vm-masters[0]

# get terrafrom secret
terraform state pull | jq '.resources[] | select(.type == "aws_iam_access_key") | .instances[0].attributes'
